## FRC LabVIEW Path Planner Swerve Drive Robot Follow Using Holonomic Drive Controller

This sample robot based on the standard LabVIEW robot project, contains both a simulated and physical robot that creates both relative and absolute trajectories using Path Planner LabVIEW.  

### Simulated Robot

This robot contains a fully modeled swerve drive robot.  To run the robot:

1. Start the FRC Driverstation and optionally start the dashboard.
1. In the LabVIEW project under the "Computer" target, open 'XXX_RobotMain.vi' and press the run arrow. 
1. A simulated field and a simulated dashboard should be displayed.  Communications with the driver station should be established.
1. Use the driver station to change the mode to "teleop enabled", then use the joystick to drive the robot.


NOTE:  Ignore the *standard* simulation field.

### Physical Robot

This sample could be modfied to run on a physical robot.  At a minimum, the following would need to be done.

The robot code needs to be modified to:
1. match the hardware that exists on the physical robot.
2. use the physical robot's differential drive track width.
3. tune the serve drive and wheel drive control parameters.
4. tune the robot orientation control
5. add filtering if needed for gyro and wheel encoder readings.

### Joystick control map

The teleop controls were assigned to an game (xbox) type controller.

- **Left Stick Y** -- Drive robot forward and backwards
- **Right Stick X** -- Drive the robot side to side.
- **Right Trigger** -- Spin the robot clockwise.
- **Left Trigger** -- Spin the robot counter clockwise.
- **A** -- Execute relative trajectory (robot orientation stays the same)
- **B** -- Execute relative trajectory (robot orientation points in direction of travel)
- **Start** -- Enable closed loop drive control (default)
- **Back** -- Disable closed loop drive control.
- **Left Bumper** -- Execute first absolute trajectory.
- **Right Bumper** -- Execute second absolute trajectory
- **POV Right** -- Enable closed loop trajectory control (default)
- **POV Left** -- Disable closed loop trajectory control.

When not executing a trajectory, combinations of the other controls can be used to drive the robot.  

### Items that may need to be customized

Bookmarks in the LabVIEW project describe some items that may need to be customed on the simulated and physical robots to maximize performance.  


### Using a Custom Trajectory

New trajectory files can be created and used.  

### Custom Dashboard

Performance and diagnostic information are written to network tables.  A custom dashboard could be created to display and trend the data.

### Network Table Variables

This sample robot publishes a number of Network Table variables that can be used to observe drive and trajectory progress and performance.


### Custom Code

All the code customizations are compartmentalized into separate routines that are then called by the standard routines in the **Team Code** project directory.
